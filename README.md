# CML Labs

A collection of network simulation labs I created during my CCNP journey using [Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)](https://www.cisco.com/go/cml).

This repo is designed to:
- Serve as a reference for CCNP-level technologies
- Demonstrate real-world and exam-aligned topologies
- Allow direct integration with CML 2.9+ via external repository support

---

## üß∞ Lab Categories

The labs are organized into directories by topic:

| Category   | Description                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `routing/` | OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, redistribution, VRF      |
| `switching/` | VLANs, STP, EtherChannel, port security  |
| `security/` | ACLs, zone-based firewall, SSH hardening |
| `overlays/` | CML overlays used in specific labs        |
| `templates/` | Starting point topologies or node configs|

Each lab file is in `.virl2` format and can be opened directly in Cisco Modeling Labs.
